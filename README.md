## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

-   I need to practice the background property, for example I don't know very well how to position images correctly. To work with the class below it cost me a lot

```css
.body {
	background: url(images/pattern-background-desktop.svg) no-repeat var(--primary);
}
```

-   I still have trouble working with the mobil
